<h1>ImageCrop Plugin for CKEditor</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

</pre>
<h3>2. Adding it to CKEditor</h3>
<p>Now add the plugin in your <em>config.js</em> or custom js configuration file like you did for the SimpleUploads, adding a comma:
<code>config.extraPlugins='simpleuploads,imagecrop'; </code>
</p>

<h3>3. Configuration</h3>
<p>The configuration is provided as a single "imagecrop" object in the configuration of each editor, example:</p>
<code>// Configuration for ImageCrop
config.imagecrop = {
	cropsizes : [
		{width:120, height:120, title:"120px square", name:"Thumbnail"},
		{width:400, height:300, title:"400 * 300", name:"Content picture"},
		{width:960, height:350, title:"960 * 350", name:"Big header"},
		{width:0, height:0, title:"No restrictions", name:"Free crop"}
		],

	formats : [
		{ title:"JPG - Low quality", value:"jpg60"},
		{ title:"JPG - Normal quality", value:"jpg80", attributes:"selected"},
		{ title:"JPG - High quality", value:"jpg90"},
		{ title:"PNG (for texts)", value:"png"}
		],

	maximumDimensions : {width:1024, height:1024}
};</code>


<p>The <b>cropsizes</b> property defines the cropping sizes that you want to allow, you must add an array of objects. Each object has four properties:<br>
"width": Final width of the resized area<br>
"height": Final height of the resized area<br>
"title": Tooltip that will be shown while hovering the button<br>
"name": Text of the button that the user will see</p>
<code>cropsizes : [
	{width:80, height:80, title:"small thumbail (80x80)", name:"Thumbnail"},
	{width:400, height:300, title:"400 * 300", name:"Content picture"},
	{width:0, height:0, title:"No restrictions", name:"Free crop"}
	]
</code>
<p>You can define as many options as you want, each one will be available as a button for the user to quickly select the final dimensions of the image.<br>
If width and height are zero the user will be able to crop the image at any size</p>

<p>After selecting the cropped area, the user has the option to select the quality that will be used to save the image, you can modify the available options with the <b>formats</b> property:</p>
<code>formats : [
	{ title:"JPG - Low quality", value:"jpg60"},
	{ title:"JPG - Normal quality", value:"jpg80", attributes:"selected"},
	{ title:"JPG - High quality", value:"jpg90"},
	{ title:"PNG (for texts)", value:"png"}
	],
</code>
<p>At the moment the maximum set of options is limited to the four ones provided above, you can remove any one that you don't like or change the default one</p>

<p>Finally, if the user presses OK on the dialog without cropping the image you can force it to be resized to a maximum width and height (preserving the ratio) with the <b>maximumDimensions</b> setting</p>
<code>maximumDimensions : {width:1024, height:1024}</code>


<h3>4. Use it</h3>
<p>Clear your cache and reload your editor. <br>
Now add an image (drag&amp;drop, take a screenshot and paste it, use the Upload button, ...), and the cropping dialog will popup:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you just press OK then it will be uploaded without changes</li>
	<li>If you select a size, then the cropping rectangle will appear that allows to select the area of interest in the picture<br>
	By pressing Crop you can finally select the quality according to the options that you have allowed</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Translations</h3>
<p>To add a new translation open plugin.js and search for "translations", it's at line 6 and add your language (the example is based on adding Polish ('pl')
  <code>    // translations
    lang : 'en,es',</code>
to<code>    // translations
    lang : 'en,es,pl',</code></p>
<p>
Then in the lang folder copy the en.js to pl.js, edit that file and in the first line set your language:
<code>CKEDITOR.addPluginLang( "imagecrop", "pl",</code>
and finally, translate all the text between quotes :-)</p>
<p>If you send it back to us, we will include it in the next versions.</p>
